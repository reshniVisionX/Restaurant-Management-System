# Restaurant-Management-System
Developed a restaurant management system using the MERN stack, enabling users to book tables, order food, and pay online. The system also allows users to view their order history and provide feedback to the restaurant. Additionally, it includes admin functionalities for managing dishes, viewing customer orders, and generating reports.
