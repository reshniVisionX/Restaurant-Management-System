That sounds like a great project! Here's a basic outline of the features you'll need to implement for your restaurant website using the MERN stack:

### Frontend (React)
1. **Login/Signup Page**: 
   - Allow users to create an account and log in using their email.
   
2. **Table Selection**: 
   - Interface for customers to select their table.
   
3. **Menu Page**: 
   - Display the menu items.
   - Allow customers to add items to their order.
   - Display the total amount of the current order.
   
4. **Order Summary Page**: 
   - Show a summary of the order with the total amount.
   - Option to confirm the order.
   
5. **Payment Page**: 
   - Integration with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
   - Option to generate the bill and complete the payment.
   
6. **Admin Dashboard**: 
   - Add, delete, and view dishes.
   - View customer orders.

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
1. **User Authentication**: 
   - Implement user registration and login.

5. **Admin Routes**: 
   - Routes for admin to manage dishes and view orders.

### Database (MongoDB)
1. **User Schema**: 
   - Store user information (email, password, etc.).
   
2. **Menu Schema**: 
   - Store menu items (name, price, description, etc.).
   
3. **Order Schema**: 
   - Store order details (items, total amount, table number, user ID, etc.).
   
4. **Table Status Schema**: 
   - Store the status of each table (available, occupied, etc.).

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup MERN Stack Environment**: 
   - Set up MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
   
2. **User Authentication**: 
   - Implement signup and login functionality.
   
3. **Menu and Order Management**: 
   - Create APIs for fetching menu items and creating orders.
   
4. **Frontend Development**: 
   - Develop React components for the user interface.

   - Implement admin functionalities for managing dishes and viewing orders.
   
7. **Testing and Deployment**: 
   - Thoroughly test the application and deploy it to a cloud service like AWS or Heroku.
